;; Extensions to simple-call-tree.el for elisp libraries.
;; 
;; 

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put simple-call-tree-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'simple-call-tree-ext)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; To automatically insert descriptions of customizable variables defined in this buffer
;; place point at the beginning of the next line and do: M-x insert-customizable-variable-descriptions

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET simple-call-tree-ext RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;	
;; 2012/11/01
;;      * First released.
;; 

;;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; 
;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; Rewrite simple-call-tree-view-function and simple-call-tree-visit-function to use
;; the markers in simple-call-tree-locations-alist.
;; Follow mode, using fm.el
;;
